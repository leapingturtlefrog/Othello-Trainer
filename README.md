**Othello Trainer Game**

This is a console implementation of the game Othello.
<br><br>
Originally I made it while learning Python (and used very poor coding practices and only functional programming). I have plans to use Numpy and Pandas to make a better version.
<br><br>
I more recently made an implementation of it in Java using bitboards to represent the game state (all 64 squares are represented in only two 64-bit integers) which was challenging and really interesting to build around.
<br><br>
For Java, there is a JAR file in as well as the original java files in [/java/othelloJar](/java/othelloJar).
<br><br>
For Python, I used auto-py-to-exe/PyInstaller to bundle the program into an executable in [/python](/python), there is also the python file `main.py` in the same directory.
