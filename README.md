# Othello Trainer Game

This is a console implementation of the game Othello.

Originally I made it a while back while learning Python (using only procedural programming) which can be found in branch [/tree/v0.0x/python](/tree/v0.0x/python).

I more recently made an implementation of Othello in Java using bitboards to represent the game state (all 64 squares are represented in only three 64-bit integers) which was challenging and fascinating to build around. For my next interation, I will use JavaFX to create a GUI and implement a basic bot to play against.

The main code is in [/src/main/java/othellotrainer](/src/main/java/othellotrainer).
